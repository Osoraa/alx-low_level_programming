# Solutions to the **_0x17-doubly_linked_lists_** project and it's problem set

## Usage Instructions

Install the gnu-C or gcc compiler for this project.

The `tests/` folder contains test cases for the solution files. You could either copy the testcases to the parent directory and then compile with:

``` C
Usage:
$ gcc [-desired-flags] *-test.c *<filename.c> -o [output-file]
```

or leave the testcases in the test folder but make sure to edit the `#include` path to reference the actual location of the `lists.h` header file.

Then compile with:

``` C
Usage:
$ gcc [-desired-flags] tests/*-test.c *<filename.c> -o [output-file]
```

Run the compilation output with:

``` C
$ ./<output-file>
```

### Strategy

Only very important solutions to my understanding would have specific commit messages as is the same with my previous submissions.

It's kinda tedious adding, committing and pushing every single time.

Employing Recursive techniques right from the start for more concise code

I'd appreciate anyone's advice on my work so far
